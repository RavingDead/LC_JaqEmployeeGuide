Lethal Company modpack for my friends. You know who you are 👁️   👁️

This aims to make a few additions to the game without being too intrusive.

This modpack also includes preset configurations.

## Major adjustments

### LethalThings
Mostly kept what felt 'vanilla' and tweaked prices for progression reasons.
- Rocket Launcher is now "end-game" pricing (900)
- Most plushies have been disabled
- Removed rugs
- Removed most scrap items (except Maxwell <3)
- Removed pinger

### Skinwalker
Only masked enemies will play player voicelines for true immersion :)

### Masked Enemy Overhaul
Everything from this mod is disabled except for the part where it picks outfits from player in the game. This makes masked enemies more like mimics, but not impossible to spot.

### Weather Multipliers
Slight adjustments to mult values:

| **Weather** | **Multipliers** |
|-------------|:---------------:|
| Rainy       | 1.05            |
| Stormy      | 1.2             |
| Foggy       | **_1.2_**       |
| Flooded     | **_1.3_**       |
| Eclipsed    | 1.5             |

## Minor adjustments
- Coroner: Removed funny notes (too crowded, makes it hard to see who died)
- GeneralImprovements: Mostly left as is, but removed things like the extra monitor info (too crowded)
- Helmet cameras: Framerate for camera reduced to 10fps for performance & style
- Mirror decor: Made it so the mirror isn't always available (so it feels extra precious)
- Suits

## Attributions
- Miku skin is modified from Boywyfe's skin (added glow in the dark + minor modifications)
